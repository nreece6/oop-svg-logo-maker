# OOP-SVG-Logo-Maker

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)



## Descritption

This application allows the user to create a custom SVG logo, taking advantage of the inquirer package and nodejs to take in user input and generate a new logo based on the responses by the user to the prompts.

The application allows the user to enter text to be displayed on the logo up to 3 characters long. The user must answer a prompt indicating if they would like a Circle, Square, or Triangle for the shape of the logo and enter a color (or hexadecimal number) for the color of the text and shape. The generated logo will take the name of the text entered by the user.
